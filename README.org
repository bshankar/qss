* Quick Sudoku solver
  Is a fast implementation of the Dancing Links Algorithm applied to Sudoku.
  This is a rust rewrite of a [[https://github.com/bshankar/fastSS][Sudoku solver]] that I wrote a while
  back. Stripped off some mediocre features and made some improvements including

  - Compacted the data structure with 16 bit cache-friendly pointers

  - Removed some unnecessary fields.

  - Much neater and safer code. (Thanks to Rust!)

  - About 30% faster. Solves all [[http://www.sudocue.net/files/top50000.zip][50000 hardest puzzles]] collection in 1.9s on my laptop.

* Usage
  Write the Sudoku as a string of 81 characters and pass it to
  =Stdin= of qss. Example usage:

  #+BEGIN_SRC bash
  # compile
  $ cargo build --release
  $ cd target/release

  # solve a puzzle
  $ echo "000000010400000000020000000000050407008000300001090000300400200050100000000806000" | qss

  # solve puzzles from a file
  $ qss < file.txt

  # benchmarking
  $ time cargo run --release < file.txt > /dev/null
  #+END_SRC
